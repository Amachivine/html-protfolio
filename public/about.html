<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, my name is Favour Ejike and it is a pleasure to meet you. I am a computer science student who enjoys learning new things
  and solving problems. I enjoy being challenged and is one who never gives up after a failure.
</p>

<p>I am currently learning Full Stack online on the website known as Udemy. Udemy is a great website where people who are teachers 
  can share knowledge on certain things. Students use this site to learn various lessons all over the world. The best part is that 
you do not have to be a student. Anyone can learn new skills from the comfort of their home </p>

<p>I believe that one should not worry about failing and so I continue to strive for success and love to encourage others with my story.
I work as a Customer Service Representative .</p>
